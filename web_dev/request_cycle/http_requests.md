1. What are some common HTTP status codes?
404 Not Found, 403 Forbidden, 500 Internal Server Error, 503 Service Unavailable, 504 Gateway Timeout.

2. What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
GET requests include all relevent data from server to run the application or page.  POST requests include user side data. You would use POST requests when processing user data or input.

3. Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?  
A web cookie is data stored in a browser when visiting a website.  It is used to better identify the user for the next visits thus tailoring the experience based on unique factors.  So, if you are on a shopping site looking for a certain type of clothing, the website will be able to show you these types of items on the home page next time you return.  You can remove cookies by clearing out the history, cache, cookies section in your browser settings.
