                <p>Thesedays topics related to health, the environment, money, crime, and happiness seem to dominate the news, which given the magnitude of their importance to our society and our individual selves, its not surprising that people can never seem to get enough information about them, so they can feel empowered and informed to improve their situation.  But what if there was a way to solve all those problems with only one change in your life; would that be worth learning more about?  I'd like to point out a few benefits of a vegan lifestyle in case it might be a suitable option for you and your family.</p>
