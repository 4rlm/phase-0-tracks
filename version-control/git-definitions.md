# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows us the ability to backup our work in a location easily accessible by us or others to share or in the event that we lose our local versions.  It is also helpful to revert to previous save points or rolling back the clock on testing work that didn't turn out as planned.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
If thinking of the project folder as a tree, the master branch might be analagous to the trunk.  From there, one or several branches could grow out of the trunk.  This provides us the ability to work separately from the master branch so that several people could be working on the same project at the time and each branch can be verified before merging back into the master.  This is where the tree analogy departs from the git hub model, in that github branches, unlike tree branches can be merged back into the master branch, or trunk.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is when we move our work to the repo.  A good commit message is one that is short and brief, yet very descriptive, such as "Scaffolded products and created CSV import/export pages/links/buttons."

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict could arise from different situations, but are essentially when work has been done on the master branch in two different versions or areas, which now differ, and can be difficult to determine which version follows the correct lineage or is more pure, or more correct.  To prevent this problem, we should always do our changes on branches, one or more branches for each contrinutor.  We might even have different branches for different sections we're working on.  But be careful with too many branches that have gone a long while without pushing to the master, as it could become very much out of sync with the versions that colleagues are using, which could potentially be tough to merge all of them together.  So be sure to push to the master as often as possible, or at least pull back from the master to help ensure you are working in the correct progression and alignment with the team.
