                    <h1>Motivational Quotes About Suffering</h1>
                    <blockquote>
                    Tell your heart that the fear of suffering is worse than the suffering itself. And no heart has ever suffered when it goes in search of its dream.
                      <cite>Paulo Coehlo</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <blockquote>
                    Suffering has been stronger than all other teaching, and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be. I have been bent and broken, but - I hope - into a better shape.
                      <cite>Charles Dickens</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <blockquote>
                    Do you not see how necessary a world of pains and troubles is to school an intelligence and make it a soul?
                      <cite>John Keats</cite>
